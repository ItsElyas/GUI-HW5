Randomized Tile Hand: When the game starts or New Hand is clicked, 7 tiles are randomly selected from the tile distribution.

Drag and Drop: Tiles can be dragged from the rack and dropped onto any of the 15 board slots.

Snap to Grid: Tiles automatically align to the center of a board slot when dropped.

Adjacency Rule: Every tile except the first must be placed directly next to an existing tile or it bounces back to the rack.

Dynamic Scoring: The Score and Current Word displays update immediately as tiles are moved onto or off the board.

Bonus Squares: The board includes two Double Word squares and two Double Letter squares that correctly multiply the score.

Score Persistence: The "Total Score" tracks the sum of all words submitted until the game is restarted.

Tiles can be moved back to the rack from the board to fix mistakes, and the score will update automatically.

Invalid Drop Revert: Tiles dropped outside of the board or rack will bounce back to their original position.
